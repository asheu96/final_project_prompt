    "## Overview and Background##\n",
    "\n",
    "The project that I have chosen to investigate is in creating a machine learning model based on predicting on whether a particular patient will be readmitted within 30-days. While the basis behind this problem may not be particularly evident, there is actually a variety of reasons why predicting whether a patient will be readmitted is particularly useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these is in terms of the financial costs to the hospital institution. The idea behind evaluating 30-day readmissions is that if a patient is sick enough to come back within 30-days of last entering the hospital, it is highly likely that they were not in a stable enough condition to be discahrged in the first place. By predicting the patients that are at high risk for readmission, it is possible to reduce the amount of unnnecessary financial burden on the hospital since readmissions are particularly draining on hospital resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second problem that this would help solve would be in reducing the amount of space that are required to house these readmitted patients. When a patient is readmitted within 30 days from their discharge, they not only drain financial resources from the hospital, but can also take up necessary bed space and hospital space that could be potentially needed to treat other patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, if physcians had the means to predict whether a patient were at high risk to be readmitted, they would be able to take extra measures to make sure the patients are kept in the hospital and not discharged until they are unlikely to be readmitted within a short period of time."

    "For the purposes of this project, I have drawn a lot of insight from the Capstone project done here: https://github.com/YaronBlinder/MIMIC-III_readmission/blob/master/Report.pdf \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on some of the previous work done, I determined the tables I wanted to download from the Mimic III database. The **admissions** table gives me relevant information such as Subject ID, Admission ID, Admit Time, Discharge Time, Death Time (if died during stay), Marital Status and Insurance provider. From the **patients** table, I can obtain information such Age and Gender. From the **lab events** I was able to determine the numerical values for lab tests based on their test ID and from **D_LABITEMS** I was able to find the lab test IDs for the actual tests that I am interested in (namely Calcium (Total), Albumin, Urea Nitrogen and Magnesium)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the **lab events** table was most likely too big to be loaded into memory of the Jupyter Notebook, I parsed out only the columns that I wanted (SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID, ITEM_ID and VALUENUM) and then took the first 2 million rows of the data set. This was done on command line using the following commands:\n",

    "In the labevents csv file, there were many cases where there was no information in the HADM_ID section. These correspond with outpatients and will not be something that I will be considering. As such, the first step that I took was in removing any NaN values that existed in the HADM_ID column of the labevents dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, since I want to be use age as a statistic, I will calculate the patient's age based on their DOB (unless they have a DOB, in which case I will calculate their age by subtracting the DOB from the DOD). To find the patients that are still alive, since I was uncertain about how the timestamps were recorded, I decided to make the current time one year after the latest date of death and use that as the current time stamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the dataset easier to visualize, upon the calculating the age, I also removed information that was not relevant to the machine learning process."
